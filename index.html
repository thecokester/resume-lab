<h1> Markus Coke </h1>

<p> Born and raised in Birmingham, AL. I graduated Huffman High School in 2007;
     After wards I Attended the University of Alabama majoring in Political Science. 
     Immediately I realized college wasn't for me so I entered the workforce in retail for a
      short period of time.Â Currently I am in the I am Bham project which is an extension of Barack Obamas tech hire initiative . 
      We attended rigorous computer programming courses over the summer.I worked for a Company called Team Enterprises that partnered 
      closely with the Miller Coors company. I learned crucial teamwork and new client engagement skills while working there. Customer service
       and satisfaction was our number 1 priority.
