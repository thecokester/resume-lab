<div class="ghandi"> You must be the change you wish to see in the world.
The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.
Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.
An eye for eye only ends up making the whole world blind.
Live as if you were to die tomorrow; learn as if you were to live forever.
First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.
You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, 
the ocean does not become dirty.The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.
Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.
A man is but the product of his thoughts; what he thinks, he becomes.</div>

<h1> Civil rights activist in South Africa (1893–1914)</h1>

<div class="line-separator"></div>
<p> In April 1893, Gandhi aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's cousin. He ended up 
spending 21 years in South Africa, where he developed his political views, ethics and politics. Immediately upon 
arriving in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination because of his skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour.
 He was not allowed to sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and asked to sit on the floor near the driver, 
then beaten up when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown
 off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class.</p>

<p> At the request of Gokhale, conveyed to him by C. F. Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an international 
    reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and organiser. He joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to 
    Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gopal Krishna Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party 
    best known for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach
     based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look wholly Indian.</p>
